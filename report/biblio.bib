  abstract = {Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system. Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087 and 1118 AlphaZero teaches itself to play three different board games and beats state-of-the-art programs in each. The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.}

  abstract = {A new paradigm for search, based on Monte-Carlo simulation, has revolutionised the performance of computer Go programs. In this article we describe two extensions to the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, which significantly improve the effectiveness of the basic algorithm. When we applied these two extensions to the Go program MoGo, it became the first program to achieve dan (master) level in 9Ã—9 Go. In this article we survey the Monte-Carlo revolution in computer Go, outline the key ideas that led to the success of MoGo and subsequent Go programs, and provide for the first time a comprehensive description, in theory and in practice, of this extended framework for Monte-Carlo tree search.}
