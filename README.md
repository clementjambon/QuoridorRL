# QuoridorRL
*an INF581 project by Nathan Pollet, Rebecca Jaubert, Laura Minkova, Erwan Umlil and Cl√©ment Jambon*

## Getting started
In order to set up the project, please use a virtual environment that can be created and activated with
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```
Then, install the required libraries with
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** the project uses `yapf` in order to format python code. Automatic formatting and lynting is already configured for `VSCode`.
